    <h3>A Note From Jen :)</h3>
        <p>This is a page dedicated to my reviews on books. Please keep in mind that all of these are MY personal opinions. This is a quick note from me before we get to actually reviewing books.</p>
        <p> 
        Personally, I like books that have more of a mystery vibe; like true crime. Even with this preference, I tend to find myself reaching for books with romance. 
          Although I am quite picky with the books I choose. What I mean is if it comes to romance, I prefer for it to be a subplot rather than the main plot; But that doesn't mean that I don't read main plot romances. 
          Normally if I find myself reading a main plot romance, it's normally angsty. Through the years, I've found that my book preference hasn't changed, I mean from elementary school to now,
          I find that I still enjoy the tropes I previously listed. Although I still LOVE those tropes, I've read various books that have shifted my perspective on SO MANY tropes and plots. 
          With this in mind, once again please keep in mind that none of these reviews are meant to bash the book or author in any way shape, or form. 
          With this being said, please enjoy! :)
