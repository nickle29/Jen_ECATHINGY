    <h3>Books I've Read<3:</h3>
    <p>Here is where I'll share the books I've read. This will include standalone books and series! </p>
    <p>I'll include reasons why I did/didn't enjoy reading them. If it's a book I enjoyed, I'll also include some of my favorite parts! </p>
    <h3>Books I want to Read<3:</h3>
      <p>This is where I'll list the books I would like to read/buy. Some of which I've already read and might just want another version of.</p>
      <p>Considering that I want different books for different reasons, I'll list them with the books! Although some might just be that I like the way they look. </p>
    <h3>Here I'll link some websites/authors I would recommend taking a look at :)</h3>
