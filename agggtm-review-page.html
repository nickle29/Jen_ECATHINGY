<h1> A Good Girl's Guide to Murder - The Series Review </h1>
<h3> A Good Girl's Guide to Murder </h3>
    <p> I want to start this review by saying that I am a true crime and all things thriller/mystery fan, so I absolutely loved this book. 
      At first, when I heard of this book on social media, I was thrown off by the title, but after hearing the tens of thousands of positive reviews, I caved.
      After finally finishing it, I can say that it's one of the best books I've read in a while. This book had me on the edge of my seat at all times reading it, 
      whether it be from the case to what the characters would do next.
