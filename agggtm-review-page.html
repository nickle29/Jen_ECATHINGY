<h3> A Good Girl's Guide to Murder </h3>
    <p> I want to start this review by saying that I am a true crime and all things thriller/mystery fan, so I absolutely loved this book. 
      At first, when I heard of this book on social media, I was thrown off by the title, but after hearing the tens of thousands of positive reviews, I caved.
      After finally finishing it, I can say that it's one of the best books I've read in a while. This book had me on the edge of my seat at all times reading it, 
      whether it be from the case to what the characters would do next.      
    </p>
    <h5>*Insert quote*</h5>
<p> I just couldn't get enough of the characters. 
  Every single one of them, no matter how irritating they were, it was always suspenseful waiting for them to appear again. It was so exciting to see
  that a detail shared at the beginning connected to a bigger problem later on in the book. There were absolutely NO loose ends. I mean Holly Jackson
  really thought of every last detail while writing this book. She really takes the ending into consideration when writing the beginning, it's AMAZING!! 
</p>

    <p> One aspect of this book that I absolutely loved is how even though the crime in this small town seemed to be wrapped up, 
      Holly Jackson found a way to add more new details to the plot. When I went into this book, I had the expectation that it would be purely crime, 
      but was pleasantly surprised by the romance subplot.

<h3> Good Girl Bad Blood </h3>

<p> Out of all three books, I personally liked this one the least. I can't really pinpoint why I like it the least, but I have a feeling that it may
  be due to the lack of excitement I felt. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't mean the book is boring, I just personally didn't feel any anticipation until 
  new characters started getting more involved. A big reason for that is probably because the book is about a family friend of Pip(our main character)
  which for some reason made it less suspenseful.
</p>

        <h5>*Insert quote*</h5>
<p> I think the book is great, but it felt like the case was going in circles. I guess that after the first book where we readers were able to meet new
  characters, the second book didn't really introduce anything new. Like towards the end we see new interesting information about one of our old 
  characters and how his past catches up with him. Other than that, I felt there was a lack of suspense. Although out of all three books, I finished
  this one faster than the others, eager to read the next book, hoping for more excitement.
</p>

    <h5>*Insert quote*</h5>

    <p> All in all, I think this book was mid. It's not the best I've ever read, but not the worst. I wouldn't read it again, but I don't regret 
      spending my time on it. 
       </p>

  <h3> As Good As Dead </h3>

<p> For the final book, I personally think that there could've been a better ending to it all. Now that doesn't mean I'm saying it's a bad book, just that
  while it does give us closure to all the crime that has happened so far, I felt either underwhelmed or overwhelmed the whole book, no in-between. 
  When I say underwhelmed, I mean I thought that the plot was progressing too slowly; when I saw overwhelmed I mean that it went from 0 to 100 so quickly, 
  I wasn't able to process it fast enough.

</p>

    <h5>*Insert quote*</h5>
<p> Aside from the ending and pace, it was a good book. Although it did take me the longest to read this compared to the other two. I think that this
  was probably due to how hard it was to get past the beginning. Not that it was bad or anything, I just think that the amount of struggle and conflict
  our main character faces is SO depressing. Like genuinely it caused me such a BAD READING SLUMP. I mean I couldn't even get past a single page.

  <h5>*Insert quote*</h5>
  
</p>  Although after I got past that point and on to the suspenseful part, it was a breeze to read. The amount of trauma that Pip goes through is so
  unexpected. Though looking back at the beginning, there were SOOOOOOO MANY things that foreshadowed that she would go through something traumatic.
  Not to mention that she was able to use her crime knowledge to her advantage is so cool to watch

      <h5>*Insert quote*</h5>
<p> The entire book is just us readers seeing how much trauma Pip has to go through just because she decided to do her capstone project on a case in her 
  hometown. Not to mention, we REALLY get to see the other characters' true colors and how UGLY they are. Aside from the trauma, the ending and the plot 
  in general are SOOOOOOOOOOOOO UNBELIEVABLY SATISFYING; ESPECIALLY THE ENDING. Overall though, nothing will EVER top the first book, no matter how AMAZING
  the ending is...

<h3>A Good Girl's Guide to Murder Series Review</h3>

  <p> I've done a review on each book, I think it's time for me to tell y'all my opinion on the series as a whole. While each individual book was 
    absolutely amazing, I think the books as a series was mid. Like the books correlate with each other, but they don't CONNECT. Like I mean that
    the books by themselves can't be read alone, aside from the first book, but while this applies, each book has its own closure; so when there's a new
    book or the start of one, it just feels unnecessary.
