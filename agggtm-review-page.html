<h3> A Good Girl's Guide to Murder </h3>
    <p> I want to start this review by saying that I am a true crime and all things thriller/mystery fan, so I absolutely loved this book. 
      At first, when I heard of this book on social media, I was thrown off by the title, but after hearing the tens of thousands of positive reviews, I caved.
      After finally finishing it, I can say that it's one of the best books I've read in a while. This book had me on the edge of my seat at all times reading it, 
      whether it be from the case to what the characters would do next.

<p> I just couldn't get enough of the characters. 
  Every single one of them, no matter how irritating they were, it was always suspenseful waiting for them to appear again. It was so exciting to see
  that a detail shared at the beginning connected to a bigger problem later on in the book. There were absolutely NO loose ends. I mean Holly Jackson
  really thought of every last detail while writing this book. She really takes the ending into consideration when writing the beginning, it's AMAZING!!

    <p> One aspect of this book that I absolutely loved is how even though the crime in this small town seemed to be wrapped up, 
      Holly Jackson found a way to add more new details to the plot. When I went into this book, I had the expectation that it would be purely crime, 
      but was pleasantly surprised by the romance subplot.
