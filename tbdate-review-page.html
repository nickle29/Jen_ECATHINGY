  <h3>They Both Die At The End</h3>
  
<p>I would like to start this review with the fact that I LOVE angst in books. Like I can read angst for DAYS and still not get enough. When I initially
heard of this book, I thought it sounded dramatic, then later on, kinda lame. BUT now having read this, I think that it's literally amazing. It has the
PERFECT amount of everything you'd ever need from a book. </p>
