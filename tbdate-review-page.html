  <h3>They Both Die At The End</h3>
  
<p>I would like to start this review with the fact that I LOVE angst in books. Like I can read angst for DAYS and still not get enough. When I initially
heard of this book, I thought it sounded dramatic, then later on, kinda lame. BUT now having read this, I think that it's literally amazing. It has the
PERFECT amount of everything you'd ever need from a book. </p>

  <h5>*Insert quote*</h5>
  
<p> When I first started this book, I thought that it was sooooooooooo boring, like to the point where I could've fallen asleep. BUT once the plot 
  started speeding up, IT WAs AMAZING!!! Though I have to say that if you're a romantic person, then you might not like it as much. While this book 
  does have romance, it's a SLOWBURN. Like I'm talking the romance starts probably 100 if not fewer pages away from the ending. 

  
</p> Speaking of romance, the amount of TENSION between the two is unbelievable. It made me want to curl up into a ball and cry. 200+ pages of pure 
  tension. AND IT WASN'T EVEN SEXUAL TENSION. Then finally when we do get to the part where they get together, ONE OF THEM DIES! HELLO?!?! LIKE WHAT. THE. 
  FUCK. I now it's kinda in the title BUT LET ME ENJOY THE ROMANCE BEFORE YOU KILL THEM OFF.

  <p> Anyways aside from that, I grew SO attached to te characters.
